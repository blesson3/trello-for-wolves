 *    RESTful endpoints that point to <code>organizations</code> refer to the
 *    Trello concept of Teams.
 *    <br><br>
 *    Trello offers the option to create teams, and to set your boards so that
 *    they belong to those teams. Just like boards, teams can have members
 *    (including team admins and normal team members). There are no limits to
 *    the number of members you can have in a team, or the number of teams you
 *    can belong to in a single account.
